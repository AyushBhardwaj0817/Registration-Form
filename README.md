Project Overview: Registration Form

1. HTML (index.html):
Structure: The HTML file defines the structure of the registration form.
Form Elements: It includes form elements such as text inputs for username, email, and password.
Submit Button: A button to submit the form.
Script Inclusion: Links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.

2. CSS (styles.css):
Styling: The CSS file provides styling for the registration form.
Container Style: Styles the container for the form with a white background, padding, and box shadow.
Form Layout: Defines the layout of the form using flexbox, aligning items in the center.
Input Styles: Styles for input fields, labels, and buttons.
Button Hover Effect: Provides a hover effect for the submit button.

3. JavaScript (script.js):
Form Submission: Handles form submission using a JavaScript function (submitForm).
Validation: Basic validation is applied using the required attribute in HTML.
Event Handling: Uses JavaScript to handle button click events and trigger form submission.

4. Overall Interaction:
User opens the HTML file in a browser.
Fills in the registration details in the form.
Clicks the "Register" button.
JavaScript function is triggered, handling the form submission.
Basic validation ensures that required fields are filled.
If validation passes, the form data can be processed further (not implemented in this simple example).

5. Purpose:
This project serves as a basic template for creating a registration form on a website.
It demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling form interactions.
You can extend the functionality by adding more validation, connecting to a server for data storage, or integrating with a backend.
This is a simple example to get you started. Depending on your project requirements, you may want to enhance features, security, and user experience.
