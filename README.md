Project Overview: Registration Form
<br>

1. HTML (index.html):
   <br>
Structure: The HTML file defines the structure of the registration form.
<br>
Form Elements: It includes form elements such as text inputs for username, email, and password.
<br>
Submit Button: A button to submit the form.
<br>
Script Inclusion: Links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.
<br>

2. CSS (styles.css):
<br>
Styling: The CSS file provides styling for the registration form.
<br>
Container Style: Styles the container for the form with a white background, padding, and box shadow.
<br>
Form Layout: Defines the layout of the form using flexbox, aligning items in the center.
<br>
Input Styles: Styles for input fields, labels, and buttons.
<br>
Button Hover Effect: Provides a hover effect for the submit button.
<br>

3. JavaScript (script.js):
 <br>
Form Submission: Handles form submission using a JavaScript function (submitForm).
<br>
Validation: Basic validation is applied using the required attribute in HTML.
<br>
Event Handling: Uses JavaScript to handle button click events and trigger form submission.
<br>

4. Overall Interaction:
   <br>
User opens the HTML file in a browser.
<br>
Fills in the registration details in the form.
<br>
Clicks the "Register" button.
<br>
JavaScript function is triggered, handling the form submission.
<br>
Basic validation ensures that required fields are filled.
<br>
If validation passes, the form data can be processed further (not implemented in this simple example).
<br>

5. Purpose:
   <br>
This project serves as a basic template for creating a registration form on a website.
<br>
It demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling form interactions.
<br>
You can extend the functionality by adding more validation, connecting to a server for data storage, or integrating with a backend.
<br>
This is a simple example to get you started. Depending on your project requirements, you may want to enhance features, security, and user experience.
